 ## What is ML
  Subset of AI that use its pattern recognition and computational learning to help computer **read an existing data** and **make prediction**

## ML Problems
  - Supervised Learning : Computer is trained with both **inputs and desired outputs**
  - Unsupervised Learning: Computer is trained only with **inputs**, leaving it to structure them itself
  - Reinforcement Learning: Computer trains itself under a **dynamic** environment/ simulation

## Types of ML - by desired outputs
  - Classification: predicts the data by sorting it into discrete classes
  - Clustering: sorts the data into groups, but the groups are not known beforehand (mostly unsupervised)
  - Regression: computer predicts continuous data 
  - Density Estimation: computer finds probability density function of a random variable (Handwriting recognition)
  - Dimensionality Reduction: Computer reduces number of variables into subsets.
